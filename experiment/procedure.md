### Procedure
# ðŸ§ª Procedure â€“ Study of Multi-stage Amplifiers (Frequency Response)

This section outlines the step-by-step procedure to perform the experiment and analyze the frequency response of multi-stage amplifiers in a virtual lab environment.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To observe and analyze how the voltage gain of multi-stage amplifiers varies with frequency and identify important parameters such as cut-off frequencies and bandwidth.

---

## ðŸ§° Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of amplifier circuits (CE, CB, CC)
- Understanding of gain, bandwidth, and Bode plots
- Familiarity with frequency response analysis

---

## ðŸ”¬ Experimental Steps

### Step 1: **Launch the Simulation**

- Open the virtual lab interface.
- Navigate to the experiment titled **"Study of Multi-stage Amplifiers (Frequency Response)"**.

---

### Step 2: **Select Amplifier Configuration**

- Choose the type of amplifier stages (e.g., CE-CE, CE-CB).
- You can choose between two-stage or three-stage amplifier configurations.

---

### Step 3: **Circuit Setup**

- The simulation will auto-generate the circuit diagram with the selected configuration.
- Circuit parameters like resistors, capacitors, and transistor models will be shown.

---

### Step 4: **Input the Signal**

- Apply a sinusoidal input signal using the virtual signal generator.
- Set the input signal amplitude and initial frequency (e.g., 1kHz).

---

### Step 5: **Frequency Sweep**

- Gradually increase the frequency of the input signal from low (e.g., 10 Hz) to high (e.g., 1 MHz).
- Use the slider or manual entry to change frequency.

---

### Step 6: **Observe Output and Gain**

- Monitor the output signal using the virtual oscilloscope.
- Calculate voltage gain \( A_v = \frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} \) at each frequency.

---

### Step 7: **Plot the Frequency Response**

- The simulation will automatically plot a Bode diagram (Gain vs Frequency).
- Note the **lower cut-off frequency**, **mid-band flat region**, and **upper cut-off frequency**.

---

### Step 8: **Analyze Bandwidth**

- Identify:
  - **Lower Cut-Off Frequency (fL)**
  - **Upper Cut-Off Frequency (fH)**
  - **Bandwidth (BW = fH - fL)**
- Observe the effect of cascading stages on bandwidth and gain.

---

### Step 9: **Stage-wise Analysis (Optional)**

- Enable "Stage-wise View" to analyze the frequency response of individual amplifier stages.
- Observe how each stage contributes to the overall gain and bandwidth.

---

### Step 10: **Multilingual Voice/Guided Explanation (Optional)**

- Click on the speaker icon for voice-assisted instructions.
- Choose between available languages for explanations on working and analysis.

---

### Step 11: **Reset or Try Another Configuration**

- Reset the simulation to test a different configuration or parameter.
- Compare the performance of different multi-stage combinations.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Output

- Bode plot of frequency vs gain
- Calculated bandwidth
- Visualization of signal behavior across frequency ranges
- Gain variation across amplifier stages

---

## âœ… Completion Criteria

- Accurate identification of cut-off frequencies and bandwidth
- Proper interpretation of the Bode plot
- Comparative analysis of different amplifier configurations
