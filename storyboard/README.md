Experiment 1: Study of Multi-stage Amplifiers (Frequency Response)

### 1. Story Outline

This experiment aims to help learners understand the behavior of multi-stage amplifier circuits in terms of frequency response. The primary objective is to simulate and analyze the voltage gain at different frequencies to study the bandwidth and overall frequency response of the circuit.

The learner begins by selecting a predefined multi-stage amplifier configuration or building one using basic circuit elements. They then apply a sinusoidal signal with varying frequencies and record the gain. The simulator displays a frequency response curve based on the readings, helping the learner understand key performance parameters like mid-band gain, bandwidth, and cut-off frequencies.
### 2. Story

In this simulation, a student explores the functioning of a multi-stage amplifier through interactive learning. They are introduced to a virtual electronic lab environment where they can visualize, modify, and simulate a two or three-stage amplifier. The process begins with the student selecting the type of amplifier and setting component values.

Once configured, the student applies an AC input signal and varies the frequency while noting the output voltage at each stage. These observations are used to calculate and plot gain versus frequency. This visual representation enables the student to identify the -3dB points and bandwidth.

By adjusting components (resistors, capacitors), the student can see how design changes impact the frequency response. The simulation supports real-time changes, making it highly interactive and educational.

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
When the simulator loads, students see a digital workspace with:

1.A circuit editor pane (drag-and-drop components like resistors, capacitors, transistors).

2.A signal generator tool to apply sinusoidal signals of varying frequency.

3.Measurement tools (voltmeter, frequency counter).

4.A graph pane to plot gain vs frequency in real-time.

5.Component properties panel for modifying values.

6.Preloaded templates of common amplifier stages.



#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:
1.Understand how frequency affects the gain of amplifier circuits.

2.Learn how to build and simulate multi-stage amplifier circuits.

3.Identify and interpret key points on a frequency response curve (cut-off frequencies, bandwidth, etc.).

4.Investigate how cascading amplifiers impacts overall gain and performance.

Users begin by selecting or building a multi-stage amplifier. They apply an AC signal, record output voltages for varying frequencies, and observe the plotted graph. Their goal is to analyze the amplifierâ€™s performance based on the shape of the frequency response.

#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

1.Component Setup: Choose from prebuilt multi-stage amplifier configurations or build from scratch.

2.Signal Input: Use a signal generator to apply a sinusoidal input, varying the frequency across a defined range.

3.Data Collection: Record output voltage at each frequency.

4.Graph Generation: Auto-plot gain (in dB) versus frequency on a logarithmic scale.

5.Analysis: Identify mid-band gain, bandwidth, and -3dB cut-off frequencies.

6.Modification: Alter circuit components and re-simulate to see the impact on the response.

7.Assessment: Answer MCQs and circuit-based questions to test understanding.



##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:

1.Interpreting the graph when gain drops unexpectedly.
2.Troubleshooting incorrect configurations (e.g., incorrect biasing).
3.Predicting output before simulation based on component values.

Questions like:

I.What happens to bandwidth if coupling capacitors are increased?
II.How does a common-emitter stage affect frequency response compared to a common-collector?


##### 2.5 Allow pitfalls:
1.If users connect stages improperly, the simulator can show zero or distorted output.
2.Incorrect capacitor values can lead to a loss of gain at lower or higher frequencies.
3.Misconfigured biasing can simulate transistor cutoff or saturation.

These help students learn the importance of each component and correct design practices.
##### 2.6 Conclusion:
At the end of the simulation, users are shown:

1.Time spent on the simulation.

2.Number of correct vs incorrect configurations.

3.Number of hints used (if any).

4.Final frequency response graph and its parameters.

The learner leaves with a deeper understanding of frequency-dependent behavior in amplifiers and how to analyze real-world multi-stage amplifier circuits.
