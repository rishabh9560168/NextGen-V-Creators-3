### Aim of the experiment
# ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To study and analyze the **frequency response** of **multi-stage amplifier circuits** by observing how the gain of the amplifier varies with frequency.

This experiment aims to help learners:

- Understand the concept and importance of frequency response in amplifier design.
- Explore the effect of cascading multiple amplifier stages on overall gain and bandwidth.
- Identify the lower cut-off, mid-band, and upper cut-off frequencies of multi-stage amplifiers.
- Visualize and interpret Bode plots for individual stages and combined amplifier circuits.
- Develop practical insights into how real-world amplifiers behave in different frequency ranges.

This simulation-based experiment equips students with theoretical and practical knowledge essential for designing and analyzing amplifier circuits in communication and signal processing systems.
