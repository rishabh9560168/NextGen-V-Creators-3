#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  : Interactive Simulation  
###### Assessment Method: Graph-based analysis, MCQs, circuit-based evaluation  

<u> <b>Description: </b>    </u>
<br>
 The student will simulate a two- or three-stage amplifier circuit. By providing a variable-frequency input, they will record output voltages at each stage and plot a frequency response graph (Gain vs Frequency). The simulator allows component modifications to study real-time changes in performance. This activity helps visualize how gain varies with frequency and how bandwidth is defined for amplifiers.
